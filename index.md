## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, 
advised by
<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/">Prof. Feizi</a>
 and
 <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/">Prof. Hajiaghayi</a>.
 
 My research centers around Deep Learning Robustness and Interpretability, with a keen interest in comprehending what models learn, how they utilize their knowledge for predictions, and understanding their successes and failures. I strive to represent these concepts in easily understandable terms, often using languages.
 
 In addition to my work in Deep Learning Robustness and Interpretability, I work in the area of Mechanism Design where my focus revolves around delegated choice mechanisms, addressing challenges such as information asymmetry and misaligned utility between principal and agents.

## Research Interests

- **Deep Learning Robustness and Interpretability:** data poisoning, vision-language models, human-understandable explainability.
- **Game Theory:** mechanism design, quality of equilibria.
